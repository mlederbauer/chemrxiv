This library was created by Magdalena Lederbauer and heavily inspired by the [arXiV Python Wrapper](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py) and the [ChemRxiv Dashboard](https://github.com/chemrxiv-dashboard/chemrxiv-dashboard.github.io/). Thanks to `fxcoudert` who open sourced the [scripts](https://github.com/fxcoudert/tools/blob/master/chemRxiv/chemRxiv.py) used for accessing the ChemRxiv via the Figshare API. As [ChemRxiv migrated to Open Engage in 2021](https://axial.acs.org/publishing/chemrxiv-open-engage-platform), the script is deprecated and this library is intended to replace and streamline it.
